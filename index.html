      <h3 style="color:White;">About Me:</h3>
      <p style="color:White;">I am a second-year college student currently attending Occidental College in Eagle Rock, California. I am planning on majoring in Economics and play on the D3 baseball team in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.</p>
      <p style="color:White;">I've recently become interested in my cultural background and am fluently bilingual in English and Korean and hope to record my experiences throughout my college attendance and soon thereafter.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="color:White;">Contact Me:</h3>
      <p style="color:White;">I am open to receive and answer questions through my email and am willing to help out or inform anyone of whatever I can help them with. My email is lkim2@oxy.edu and I am available Monday through Saturday to get back to my emails in quick fashion.</p>

      <h3 style="color:White;">Purpose:</h3>        
      <p style="color:White;">I wanted to create this blog in order to record my student experiences and talk about the negatives and positives I go through during my college ordeals. I always hope to record future travels I have and what I plan to do as well.</p>
      <p style="color:White;">In fact, I plan to travel to South Korea during the summer of 2020 and will input advice or some suggestions if you plan to go there as well! For example, here's a link I've found that may help in your travel plans: <a href="https://www.touropia.com/best-places-to-visit-in-south-korea/">Click this link to be redirected</a></p>
